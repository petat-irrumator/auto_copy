# auto_copy

a python script and a shell script that will ask you the source directory , destination
directory,and the number of files to copy (this is because the 
destination directory's size is not big enough to accumulate all the
source's directory files. In this case the size of the destination
directory is 14gb which is a usb and the source directory size is 
38 gb ,so the script will ask the number of files which will be 
14 in this case (cause 14 files of 1gb is 14gb) and then copy those
14 files of 1gb to the source directory)
